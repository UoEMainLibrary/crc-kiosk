It was made in Florence by Giovanni da Bologna, most probably in the late 1580s. It was recorded in the Villa Mattei in Rome during the 17th and 18th centuries and was bought by Sir James Erskine of Torrie, Bart., who brought it to Scotland at the beginning of the 19th century. It was bequeathed to the University of Edinburgh by his with the rest of his collection of old master paintings and bronzes, and came into the possession of the University of Edinburgh in 1836. The horse is an \u00e9croch\u00e9, showing the muscles of the animal in detail. Its original purpose is unknown, but it may have been made as a study for the equestrian statue of Duke Cosimo I of Florence cast in 1591 and which has stood in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence since that date. The \u00e9croch\u00e9 character gives the sculpture an extraordinary clarity and precision which is combined effortlessly with the grace and beauty of the living animal. This is evidence of a scientific as well as an artistic intention on the part of the artist and reveals the importance to him of the influence and example of Leonardo da Vinci. The most recent monumental equestrian sculpture in Florence, before that of the Duke Cosimo I, had been Leonardo's never completed monument to Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. The artist of the Torrie horse would have had Leonardo's studies for this bronze in mind, but, even more, he must have looked very carefully at the drawings and notes that Leonardo made for a projected treatise on the anatomy and proportions of the horse, reflecting the life-long fascination that it had for him. The Torrie horse bears a close relationship to several drawings by Leonardo related to this project in the collection of Her Majesty the Queen at Windsor. Other artists, too, knew and learned from Leonardo's study of the horse but none came so close as Giovanni da Bologna did here to his vision of the beauty of the animal celebrated by art and science together. Giovanni da Bologna was born in what is now Northern France in 1529. The name by which he is generally known is the Italian rendering of his French name, Jean de Boulogne \u0096 but most of his working life was spent in Florence in the service of the Medici. He died in Florence in 1608. He knew Michelangelo as an old man and undoubtedly drew inspiration from him, as in the case of the bronze horse, he drew inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci, but he was a profoundly original artist in his won right and was one of the most influential sculptors in European history. He was an exceptionally fertile and inventive artist producing works of great beauty and originality which ranged from monumental designs for city squares to small bronzes and terra cottas.
